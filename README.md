# Emergent Symmetry

This repository is the source code for the paper arXiv: [2210.17539](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17539). The codes have a dependence on [ncon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0939).

The input MPS tensors could be either multidimensional arrays of MATLAB or matrix cell arrays as in the /inputexample folder, which could be generated by [VUMPS](https://github.com/Darkdragon84/IMPS_ML_tools).
